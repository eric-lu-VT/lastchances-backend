# CRUD Template - Backend - PostgreSQL

This repository is the default backend starter pack for new DALI React projects. Installation and setup instructions are included below. You should eventually customize this README file with project-specific documentation.

## Setup

1. clone repo and `npm install`
2. Install PostgreSQL + management tool
  - Windows
    - Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview)
    - Follow directions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-postgresql) to install PostgreSQL on WSL
    - Install [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)
    - Follow directions [here](https://www.vultr.com/docs/install-pgadmin-4-for-postgresql-database-server-on-ubuntu-linux/) to connect pgAdmin to PostgreSQL and WSL
  - MacOS
    - Ensure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is installed
    - Run `brew install postgresql` if PostgreSQL isn't installed
    - If you'd like to use a GUI to interact with PostgreSQL, download one. We recommend [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
3. Create a PostgreSQL DB called `backend_template` if setting up locally, using your GUI of choice (Postico or pgAdmin).
4. Set up Google Developer API (for email sending)
   - You will need to enable [2 Step Auth](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839) on your desired Google account and generate an [App Specific Password](https://myaccount.google.com/security). See this [StackExchange thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19877246/nodemailer-with-gmail-and-nodejs?answertab=modifieddesc#tab-top) for more details.
   - Alternatively just comment out all the nodemailer stuff if you don't want to use/need to set up the email service.
   - Note that you'll have to do a lot more email/domain configuration before the email service will adequately work in production. (Instructions for this TBD)
5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory
  - Should be in the following format:
  - ```
    AUTH_SECRET=*secret assortment of characters used for encryption*
    PORT=*insert desired backend server port here*
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/backend_template
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=*Google Developer API email*
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_PASS=*Google Developer API password*
    ```
6. Run `npx sequelize db:migrate` to apply migrations to DB.
7. Run `npx sequelize db:seed:all` to load initial data.
8. App should be ready for use now
  - `npm start` to run in production mode
  - `npm run dev` to run with hot reloading

#### Redux Debugging

Download the [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) extension.

#### Linting

ESLint is set up in this project. To keep code clean, always remember to run `npm run lint` and fix any lint problems before merging into master.

#### Unit Testing

Jest unit testing is set up for the controllers, routers, and services. Remember to run `npm test` and fix any breaking changes that might've occured. 
  - You can also run just an individual test file with `npm test -- *filename*`
